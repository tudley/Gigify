# üéµ Welcome to Gigify

This lightweight Flask application allows you to connect to your Spotify account and creates a custom playlist based on upcoming gigs in your area and your listening preferences.

At this current time, the following functionalities exist:

  Backend local deployment:
    - You can run the flask application'gigify.py' and use manual url routing.
    - The following URLs are routed as API endpoints for my frontend:
      - '/events/bristol' - please enter a city you'd like to query TicketMaster about
      - '/artists/pixies' - please enter an artist you'd like to query Spotify about

  API integration:
    - Currently working on APIIntegration.py, a script pulling my seperate API calls together, here I'm facing challenges such as IP location services giving me 'locations' not in TicketMasters database (ie. Windsor, instead of London)
